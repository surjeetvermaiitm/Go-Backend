# Go - The Complete Guide

This repository contains course resources (code snapshots, slides) for my [Go - The Complete Guide course](https://acad.link/golang).

## How To Use

The [/code](/code/) folder contains multiple code snapshots for every course sections. You can use the code stored in that folder to compare your code to mine in case you're getting stuck when following along with the course.

The [/attachments](/attachments/) folder contains lecture-specific attachments (i.e., files which are directly attached to individual course lectures) like starting project snapshots.

The [/other](/other/) folder contains other resources - e.g, the course slides.
